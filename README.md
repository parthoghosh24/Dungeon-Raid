# Dungeon Raid
Dungeon raid is a free third person stealth/action game where the player (Haiya, the bounty hunter) has to work their way up to reach the top of a evil dreaded dungeon to rescue the brave knight from the clutches of evil.
* Perform stealth kills
* Or you can go full on hack'n'slash. Be mindful that you can be easily overwhelmed by the enemies.
* Epic boss battles.
* Lighthearted fun story.
This is built in Godot engine.

## Inspirition
This game is inspired from games like metal gear solid, tenchu and zelda.

## Why this got made?
Well, I decided to teach myself game development and after months of dabbling with Godot engine, I decided to make this game as an exercise to learn Godot engine.

## How to work with the source code?
Well if you are well verse with how Git works, then you will not have any issues. But a rudimentary list of steps can be followed is as below:
* Ensure you have Godot engine (4.3 is better as this game runs on that).
* clone this project.
* Then try to open it in Godot engine itself.

## Why the code is open-source/public?
Well, I would like to support the community and aspiring game devs who would want to make a finished game. This game project has many aspects which I believe people can learn from. Some aspects are:
* How to design levels?
* How 3d & other assets that are imported to be used in the game?
* How to implement enemy AI and combat logic?
* How to implement gameplay?
* How to use the AnimationPlayer to make animations as well as cutscenes?
* How to use shaders to implement special effects?
* How to code in GDScript?

This codebase is definitely not an exhaustive guide but can give people a headstart whosoever is interested in learning Godot and make their own 3D games.
